Egyptian Universities Guide
this is first front-end project I uploaded here on github.
Overview
The Egyptian Universities Guide is a web-based platform designed to help students explore and compare universities in Egypt, discover scholarship opportunities, and make informed decisions about their higher education. The platform provides detailed information about universities, their programs, rankings, and scholarships, along with an interactive map for locating institutions and nearby housing. It includes user authentication features for personalized experiences, such as saving preferences and accessing a profile.

This project is built using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS for styling), and JavaScript for client-side functionality. It uses local storage for user authentication and session management.
